# To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data persistence using `localStorage`. It allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks, while maintaining the list between page reloads.

## Requirements

### HTML
- Create a page layout with:
  - An input field for entering a new task
  - A button to add the new task to the list
  - A display area to show the list of tasks
- For each task, display:
  - The task text
  - A button to mark it as "completed"
  - A button to delete the task

### CSS
- Style the page with a clean and visually appealing to-do list layout.
- Apply styling for completed tasks (e.g., text strikethrough or color change).
- Add styles to buttons, including colors, borders, and hover effects.

### JavaScript
- Implement logic to:
  - Add a new task to the list
  - Mark a task as completed (with styling changes for completed tasks)
  - Delete a task from the list
- Ensure that the task list's state (added, completed, or deleted tasks) persists in `localStorage`.
- Reload the to-do list from `localStorage` when the page is refreshed.

### Additional Requirements
- Add input validation to prevent adding empty tasks.
- Include a "Clear List" button to delete all tasks at once (with a confirmation prompt).
